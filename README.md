## Brief problem statement

There is a disconnect between individuals in need and those willing to offer assistance,
including NGOs and donors. Many who want to help struggle to find reliable platforms to
post offers or identify specific needs, while privacy concerns deter some from seeking or
offering help. This leads to delays in delivering essential resources like food, clothing, or
aid. Additionally, NGOs face challenges in attracting significant funding for their projects.
A platform is required to bridge these gaps, featuring innovative tools like anonymous
posting, problem simulations, and a 3D virtual environment to showcase NGO work and
boost engagement.
